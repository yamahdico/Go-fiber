### Explanation for Running the Code

If you want to run the Fiber 3 application, you need to adjust the database connection string (`dsn`) in the `db.Connect()` function to match your local or production database configuration. The current `dsn` is set as follows:

```go
dsn := "username:Password@tcp(localhost:3306)/Database?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"
```

Hereâ€™s what each part represents:
- **`root`**: The username for the MySQL database.
- **`21`**: The password for the MySQL database.
- **`localhost`**: The database host (use `127.0.0.1` or a server IP for production).
- **`3308`**: The MySQL server port (default is usually `3306`, so update if necessary).
- **`fiber`**: The name of the database to be used.
- **`charset=utf8mb4`**: Sets the character encoding.
- **`parseTime=True`**: Ensures time fields are parsed correctly.
- **`loc=Local`**: Sets the time zone to local.

### Steps to Update:
1. Replace `root` and `21` with your MySQL username and password.
2. Adjust `localhost` and `3308` if your database runs on a different host or port.
3. Replace `fiber` with the name of the database you have created.

For example, if your database runs on the default port (`3306`) and your database name is `mydatabase`, you would update the `dsn` as:

```go
dsn := "myuser:mypassword@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/mydatabase?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"
```

After making this change, save the file and run your application. The updated `dsn` will allow your app to connect to the correct MySQL database.
